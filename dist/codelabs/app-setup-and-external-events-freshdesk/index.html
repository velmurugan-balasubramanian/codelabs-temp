      <google-codelab-step label="Get Set Up" duration="1">
        <p>Let&#39;s start learning about app setup and external events by going ahead and downloading sample code. It contains everything you need to just focus on learning by leveraging existing boilerplate code.</p>
<p>Current tutorial is an App running on Freshdesk.</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/freshworks-developers/app-setup-and-external-events-freshdesk.git
</code></pre>
<p>Or you can also</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/freshworks-developers/app-setup-and-external-events-freshdesk/archive/start.zip" target="_blank">Download zip file</a></p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Code Guide</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t run the code just yet. Let&#39;s understand the code that&#39;s already existing in your boilerplate. You would notice <code>app/</code> , <code>config/</code> folders for an app that&#39;s only going to use <code>server/server.js</code> . Unfortunately, it is not advisable to skip <code>app/</code>and <code>config/</code> folders as CLI may throw errors. This restriction may be removed in the future. So those folders exist to have code just to pass CLI validations.</p>
<p>We will work on <code>server.js</code>going forward.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="App Setup Events" duration="3">
        <p>App setup events let your app execute handlers when the app is either being installed or uninstalled.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s go ahead and write app setup events</p>
<p>Open <code>server/server.js</code>and write</p>
<pre><code>exports = {
  events: [
    { event: &#39;onAppInstall&#39;, callback: &#39;onInstallHandler&#39; },
    { event: &#39;onAppUninstall&#39;, callback: &#39;onUninstallHandler&#39; }
  ],
  onInstallHandler: function (payload) {
    console.info(&#39; Observed on App Install &#39;, payload);
    renderData();
  },
  onUninstallHandler: function (payload) {
    console.info(&#39;Observed on App Uninstall&#39;, payload);
    renderData();
  }
};
</code></pre>
<ol type="1">
<li>The <code>exports</code> will allow your code defined to be available in the scope of the platform.</li>
<li><code>exports</code> is assigned with an object with <em>events</em> and <em>handlers</em> as it&#39;s properties.</li>
<li>The <code>events</code>key is associated with an array of objects where each object is an event Name associated with the callback name. In the above example, <code>{ event: &#39;onAppInstall&#39;, callback: &#39;onInstallHandler&#39; } and { event: &#39;onAppUninstall&#39;, callback: &#39;onUninstallHandler&#39; }</code></li>
<li>The function handler can be defined as desired. In the current case, we are simply logging <code>payload</code>. An argument passed to the parameter of the handler to let the handler have access to information it may need when the app installs and uninstalls respectively.</li>
<li>Finally invoke <code>renderData()</code> platform method that must be used at the end of the handler. This lets the app to either let the installation to proceed or halt to throw an error message if needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now that we understand the code here a little bit, let&#39;s go ahead and run it</p>
<pre><code>❯ fdk run
Starting local testing server at http://*:10001/
Append &#39;dev=true&#39; to your Freshdesk account URL to start testing
e.g. https://domain.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/1?dev=true
Quit the server with Control-C.

To simulate product, app setup, and external events, visit - http://localhost:10001/web/test
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the button line to test app setup events. Let&#39;s go ahead and open the same URL in a Browser.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img src="img/4e97104e2932ec26.png"></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Select the dropdown and select <code>onAppInstall</code></li>
<li>The JSON that you see in this simulation page is actually a payload that will be passed as an argument to onInstallHandler</li>
<li>By default your CLI will fill in the information for you based on equivalence within production.</li>
<li>Click on ‘Simulate&#39;.</li>
</ol>
<p>In my case, the following is printed to the terminal</p>
<pre><code> Observed on App Install  {
  timestamp: 1496400354326,
  account_id: &#39;13&#39;,
  domain: &#39;https://sample.freshdesk.com&#39;,
  event: &#39;onAppInstall&#39;,
  region: &#39;US&#39;,
  iparams: {}
}
</code></pre>
<p>It is the desired log as defined in the <code>onInstallHandler(){..}</code></p>
<p>This is the same with onAppUninstall event as well.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="External Events" duration="0">
        <p>Duration : 4</p>
<p>The idea behind external events is to have the app invoke a handler whenever something desired happens in the 3rd party systems. For example, if a payment fails with a payment provider, we can have a ticket created automatically in Freshdesk.</p>
<p>Webhooks are URL endpoints that can help us solve these problems. The 3rd party payments provider performs the payments with a mechanism that whenever the payment fails it makes a HTTP request with POST method to an webhook endpoint which intern invokes the Handler function.</p>
<p>On Freshworks Developer Platform, you will need to</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Generate a Webhook URL endpoint by invoking a <code>generateTargetUrl()</code> function.</li>
<li>Send the URL to the 3rd party system to have it remember the Webhook URL. Usually, apps perform this action onAppInstall</li>
<li>App will wait to invoke onExternalEventHandler until the 3rd party notifies the app. That&#39;s by sending an HTTP POST request to the Webhook URL.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#39;s see the same by writing some code,</p>
<pre><code>exports = {
  events: [
    { event: &#39;onAppInstall&#39;, callback: &#39;onInstallHandler&#39; },
    { event: &#39;onAppUninstall&#39;, callback: &#39;onUninstallHandler&#39; },
    { event: &#39;onExternalEvent&#39;, callback: &#39;onExternalEventHandler&#39; }
  ],
  onInstallHandler: async function (payload) {
    try {
      const webhook = await generateTargetUrl();
      const options = {
        body: `{&#39;webhook&#39;: ${webhook}}`,
        action: &#39;register&#39;
      };
      const { response } = await $request.post(thirdPartyEndpoint, options);

      console.info(&#39;\n Webhook creation successful \n&#39;, webhook);
      console.info(&#39;\n Webhook Registration Successful \n&#39;, response);
      console.info(&#39;\n Hander received following payload when app is installed \n\n&#39;, payload);

      renderData();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(&#39;Something went wrong. Webhook Registration has failed&#39;);
    }
  },
  onUninstallHandler: async function (payload) {
    try {
      const options = {
        action: &#39;de-register&#39;
      };
      const { response } = await $request.post(thirdPartyEndpoint, options);
      console.info(&#39;\n Webhook De-Registration Successful \n&#39;, response);
      console.info(&#39;\n Hander received following payload when app is uninstalled \n\n&#39;, payload);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(&#39;Something went wrong. Webhook De-Registration has failed&#39;, error);
    }
    renderData();
  },
  onExternalEventHandler: function (payload) {
    const { data } = payload;
    console.info(&#39;\n Desired action occurred within 3rd party&#39;);
    console.info(&#39; onExternalEventHandler invoked with following data: \n&#39;, data);
  }
};
</code></pre>
<ol type="1">
<li>The <code>events</code> has an array of objects each attaching a handler to an event name. For the app to leverage External Events, <code>{ event: &#39;onExternalEvent&#39;, callback: &#39;onExternalEventHandler&#39; }</code>is added to the <code>events</code> array.</li>
<li>On the app install we&#39;re creating the webhook by <code>generateTargetUrl()</code>[returns a promise] and POSTing it to the 3rd party system.</li>
<li>The handler <code>onExternalEvent</code> would simply print some data and message of confirmation to the terminal.</li>
<li>Likewise, one last step is to deregister the webhook from the 3rd party <code>onAppUninstall</code> as it&#39;s no longer needed.</li>
</ol>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Simulation" duration="4">
        <p>Let&#39;s now simulate each handler attached to respective <code>events</code>.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>onAppInstall</h2>
<p>Open <a href="http://localhost:10001/web/test" target="_blank">http://localhost:10001/web/test</a></p>
<p>Select <code>onAppInstall</code> and click simulate</p>
<pre><code> Webhook creation successful
 http://localhost:10001/event/hook/freshdesk

 Webhook Registration Successful
 { &#34;success&#34;: true }

 Hander received following payload when app is installed

 {
  timestamp: 1496400354326,
  account_id: &#39;13&#39;,
  domain: &#39;https://sample.freshdesk.com&#39;,
  event: &#39;onAppInstall&#39;,
  region: &#39;US&#39;,
  iparams: {}
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that webhook url is on <code>http</code>protocol. Sometimes, 3rd parties expect webhook url to be on <code>https</code> protocol. We will discuss towards the end of this tutorial.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>onExternalEvent</h2>
<p>In the same simulation page, you can simulate onExternalEvent and you&#39;d see messages print to terminal like follows:</p>
<pre><code> Desired action occured within 3rd party
 onExternalEventHandler invoked with following data:
 {
  timestamp: 1500456400209,
  event: &#39;user_created&#39;,
  user: { id: &#39;557058:d2254582&#39;, email: &#39;xyz@xyz.com&#39; }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We can make this more interesting by doing HTTP POST to the webhook we&#39;ve generated. In a new Terminal with closing earlier where app is being served, Let&#39;s manually make a cURL request in the shoes of 3rd party:</p>
<pre><code>❯ curl -X POST -H &#34;Content-Type: application/json&#34; \
    -d &#39;{&#34;name&#34;: &#34;3rd party&#34;, &#34;email&#34;: &#34;mee@example.com&#34;}&#39; \
    http://localhost:10001/event/hook/freshdesk
</code></pre>
<p>Response:</p>
<pre><code>{ &#34;success&#34;: true }
</code></pre>
<p>This is an example of how 3rd party would send some data to the webhook. In this case <code>{&#34;name&#34;: &#34;3rd party&#34;, &#34;email&#34;: &#34;me@example.com&#34;}</code> is POST to webhook. Ideally, we should see onExternalEventHandler getting Invoked with relevant data passed. So let&#39;s switch to terminal where CLI is serving the app,</p>
<pre><code> Desired action occured within 3rd party
 onExternalEventHandler invoked with following data:
 { name: &#39;3rd party&#39;, email: &#39;mee@example.com&#39; }
</code></pre>
<p>The handler received the data as an argument and executed the code to print the above messages to the terminal.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>onAppUninstall</h2>
<p>In the simulation page, select onAppUninstall and simulate the app,</p>
<p>The following would be printed to the terminal</p>
<pre><code> Webhook De-Registration Successful
 { &#34;success&#34;: true }

 Hander received following payload when app is uninstalled

 {
  timestamp: 1496400354326,
  account_id: &#39;13&#39;,
  domain: &#39;https://sample.freshdesk.com&#39;,
  event: &#39;onAppUninstall&#39;,
  region: &#39;US&#39;,
  iparams: {}
}
</code></pre>
<h2 is-upgraded>Public Webhooks in HTTPS</h2>
<p>In order to generate webhooks URLs on https protocol, Freshworks CLI relies on <a href="https://ngrok.com/" target="_blank">ngrok</a> under the hood. After you sign up on ngrok, <a href="https://dashboard.ngrok.com/get-started/your-authtoken" target="_blank">find an auth token</a> within the ngrok&#39;s dashboard.</p>
<p>In the Terminal, restart the CLI with:</p>
<pre><code>fdk run --tunnel --tunnel-auth &lt;auth-key&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You should see,</p>
<pre><code>❯ fdk run --tunnel --tunnel-auth 1p-6mq3GG-example-token-jRuyK-JhhA
Establishing ngrok tunnel. Please wait...

Tunnel Open. Tunnel URL: https://183d8c7012c4.ngrok.io

Starting local testing server at http://*:10001/
Append &#39;dev=true&#39; to your Freshdesk account URL to start testing
e.g. https://domain.freshdesk.com/a/tickets/1?dev=true
Quit the server with Control-C.

To simulate product, app setup, and external events, visit - http://localhost:10001/web/test
</code></pre>
<p>Now, if you simulate <code>onAppInstall</code>, you should see:</p>
<pre><code>Webhook Registration Successful
 { &#34;success&#34;: true }

 Hander received following payload when app is installed

 {
  timestamp: 1496400354326,
  account_id: &#39;13&#39;,
  domain: &#39;https://sample.freshdesk.com&#39;,
  event: &#39;onAppInstall&#39;,
  region: &#39;US&#39;,
  iparams: {}
}
</code></pre>
<p>For the same handler that is defined in this tutorial. Notice you get a random URL on HTTPS as desired. This will work exactly as we discussed during the simulation section of this tutorial.</p>
