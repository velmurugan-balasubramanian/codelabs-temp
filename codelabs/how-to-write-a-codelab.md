# How to Write a Codelabs.
How to Write a Codelabs the right way
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --> 
## Overview 
Duration: This tutorial focuses on creating an app that helps developers get accustomed to the advanced features of the Freshworks platform. In this segment, we will develop an app that creates a ticket in Freshdesk based on user input.

### What You'll Learn 
- how to set the amount of time each slide will take to finish 
- how to include code snippets 
- how to hyperlink items 
- how to include images 
- other stuff

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --> 
## Setting Duration

To indicate how long each slide will take to go through, set the `Duration` under each Heading 2 (i.e. `##`) to an integer. 
The integers refer to minutes. If you set `Duration: 4` then a particular slide will take 4 minutes to complete. 

The total time will automatically be calculated for you and will be displayed on the codelab once you create it. 

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- --> 
## Code Snippets

To include code snippets you can do a few things. 
- Inline highlighting can be done using the tiny tick mark on your keyboard: "`"
- Embedded code

### JavaScript

```javascript
{ 
  key1: "string", 
  key2: integer,
  key3: "string"
}
```

### Java

```java
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
  // code block to be executed
}
```
